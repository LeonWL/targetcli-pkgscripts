The rpm and deb example packaging scripts targetcli-fb, rtslib-fb, and configshell-fb were removed because each major distribution should have its own packaging in place for these components. This is good because the example scripts did not see much testing and frequently were broken.

Even though we are not willing to maintain them, some community members have indicated they found these useful. They are extracted and placed here in the hopes that interested parties can create a new solution for their needs, using these as a starting point.

PRs and collaborator requests welcome!
